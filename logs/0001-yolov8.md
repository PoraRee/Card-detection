# Yolo v8 Experiment

To establish a baseline for our project. The [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) is trained on [Roboflow Poker Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-100/poker-cards-cxcvz).

The result and the code is recorded in the notebook `YoloRoboflowPoker.ipynb`. It was found the the model performs terribly at even clear and obvious example and also cannot handle occlusion.

This is likely because the model is not designed with symbol nor character in mind. This indicates that this task should be viewed as mmore of an OCR task rather than object detection task.

## Next Step

- Investigate more finer-level detail model like those in OCR
- Construct Frontend
